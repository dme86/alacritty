# alacritty

Normally, I am a big fan of [st](https://github.com/dme86/st), but switching from Linux to macOS on a daily basis makes it necessary to have a terminal that runs on both operating systems.

My config isn't finished yet, but I'm backing it up nonetheless. Nothing particularly special at the moment â€“ using [tmux](https://github.com/dme86/tmux) as the default status bar and tab manager.
